You will find the analysis folder currently contains two .Rmd files (condAnalysis.Rmd & watLevAnalysis.Rmd). 

When compiled, they produce pdfs. 

All figures produced by the .Rmd's will be saved in condFigures and watLevelFigures. 

I have not posted any of the data that Emily sent me, both because they are too large for GitHub and 
because I'm not sure we want the files public yet. 

If you want to reproduce the analysis, or parts of it, you can download the repository. 
Please note that you will need all files that Emily has sent me over the months. I can send them in a zip. 

You might also need to install various R packages. Please let me know if you have any questions.
